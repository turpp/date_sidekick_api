<h1 align="center">Welcome to dateSidekick 👋</h1>
<p>
</p>

> This is the backend API for Date sidekick. Deciding what where to go on a date is hard. I have spend countless hours debating what place to eat at or what activity to do. Date Sidekick fixes this issues. There are two main functions of Date Sidekick. 

>Random Mode: This is my personal favorite, enter your zipcode and select food or food and activity and date sidekick will give you a date in your area. 

>If you want more control you can always create your own date from a selection of items in your area. Once you decide on a date you can save it to your profile for later use. 

>Date Sidekick uses Yelp-Fusion API to get all the information. 

>Frontend is built with React and styled with bootstrap. https://github.com/turpp/dateSidekick
